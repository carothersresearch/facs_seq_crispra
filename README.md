The notebooks in this folder are intended to be used to test a data pipeline which will take in data generated by the Illumina sequencer.

## Setup
* Make sure you have Python and Anaconda installed on your machine
* navigate to the ``setup`` folder using your anaconda prompt
* run the command: ``conda env create -f carothers_env.yml``
* run the command: ``conda activate carothers``
* run the command: ``jupyter notebook``
* open up the jupyter notebook files you'd like to open

## Mock Data Generation

### Files
* ``mock bins.ipynb``: generates fluorescence histograms for each guide and saves the true mean and variance used to generate each
* ``mock fastq.ipynb``: uses the bins generated by mock bins.ipynb to create two fastq files, which look similiar to what will be returned by the illumina sequencer.

Each file should contain more specific documentation as to it's usage
